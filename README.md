# React + Vite

This to-do list application, built with React.js, Redux, and Bootstrap, offers a seamless user experience for managing tasks. Utilizing React components and Redux state management, it enables users to easily add, delete, and mark tasks as completed, while being deployed on Vercel for accessibility.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
